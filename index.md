### My Faves

As I mentioned, I am a huge sports junkie and most of my time is spent watching the teams or players that I love. 
Being from Texas, of course I am a fan of America's Greatest Football team the Dallas Cowboys. 
You too can join in on the action by visiting their [official website](https://www.dallascowboys.com) to catch the next game!  

If you saw my above photos and want to see more of what my agency does, I encourage you to check out the AFOSI official [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RealAFOSI).

Lastly, I want to share one of my favorite YouTube creators who has published tons of content on Computer Programming. His page has helped me out tremendously with not only the classes at Southwestern but also my own personal goals of one day becoming a Software Developer. Check him out!
